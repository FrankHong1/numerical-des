# Numerical DEs

In this repo I publish code I write for solving DEs numerically.

Mostly basic methods (Euler, etc.) implemented manually for practice.


## ODE methods [WIP]
I am working on implementing simple ODE methods in Python, starting from Euler forwrd / backward schemes, with some applications. Really toy problems with toy examples.

## PDE methods [coming soon...]
I am no stranger to theory, but implementing PDE solvers is still ahead of me.

I will do this manually using `numpy` first and see how it goes before playing with some pre-made libraries.
